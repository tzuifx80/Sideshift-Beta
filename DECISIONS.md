# Decisions

## 2026-07-20 Android beta completion

- Basic request identity is derived from `debateId` and round, sanitized to the server's accepted request-header alphabet, and reused for safe retries.
- Backgrounding invalidates the active client response and leaves the user turn persisted for retry; no background service was introduced.
- Profile media uses the shared browser/system picker and 512px WebP processing. No Capacitor Camera dependency was added; native camera capture remains a physical-device check and is not claimed as verified.
- No database migration was added or changed.
